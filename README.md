# Usage

 - Run the container from the remote Docker image and falls into the container bash 

 ```shell
 sudo docker run -it --name apb sim4n6/apentestbox:latest
 ```

 In case, you need to re-use the container:

 ```shell
 sudo docker start apb
 sudo docker exec -it apb bash 
 ```

# Usage for Build

 - Build an image from the current directory Dockerfile.

```shell
sudo docker build . -t apentestbox
```

 - List the Docker images.

```shell
sudo docker images
```

 - Launch a container from the image **apentestbox** in the background.

```shell
sudo docker run -d --name apb apentestbox
```

 - List the Docker containers.

```shell
sudo docker container ls
```

 - Run a command in the container.

```shell
sudo docker exec -it apb whoami
```

 - Fall to `bash` shell within the container. You can escape later the container using `exit`.

 ```shell
 sudo docker exec -it apb bash
 ```

 # TO-DO

  - [x] rewrite USAGE section for a more concise one, maybe an advanced part.
  - [ ] consider using `.env`.
  - [ ] work on `docker-compose` file with `.env` use.
  - [ ] consider adding `docker compose up` command to the USAGE as an alternative.
  - [ ] figure out how to handle the `.config` for *notify & subfinder*.
  - [ ] Docker volumes use.
  - [ ] Read carefully [Dockerfile best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/).
  - [x] push to Docker hub repostiory.
  - [ ] link the Docker hub repo to gihthub.
  - [ ] consider Github actions as a testing to be performed on PR trigger.
  - [ ] add nice clickable cards
